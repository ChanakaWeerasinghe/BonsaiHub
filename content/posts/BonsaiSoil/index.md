There are many different soil mixtures used to plant bonsai. Bonsai people in
Florida, Scotland, Holland, Japan, Canada and California all have different growing
conditions and different materials available to make soil mixtures. Most mixtures
have one thing in common -- they don't use garden soil. This is because shallow pots
don't drain as well as soil in the garden and as a result the roots can stay too wet
and rot!

##Soil PH
Soil pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the soil on a scale of 0 to 14.
Neutral is 7, while less than 7 is acidic, greater than 7 is akalai. Soil pH affects the
amount of nutrients that are soluble in soil water and, therefore, the amount of
nutrient available to plants. Some nutrients are more available under acid
conditions while others are more available under alkaline conditions. Most
deciduous trees (e.g. maples, elms) prefer soil that is nearly neutral – 6.5 ph. But
conifers prefer a slightly more acidic soil, around 5.5 ph.

* Akadama and sand are used for moisture retention. Akadama is slightly acidic
* Lava and pumice are used to improve drainage. Lava has an average porosity
of 70-90% (depending a bit on type and size) and is listed as an inert material
so no influence on pH values.
* Pumice has an average porosity of 90% and has a tendency to increase pH
values slightly. It has the added advantage of weighing much less than lava.
Pines and junipers prefer a slightly more acidic soil, so using Kanume (4.5 – 5
ph.) instead of pumice is recommended
  
* Turface is most commonly used as a soil additive to help improve drainage.

Turface absorbs its weight in water while decreasing soil compaction, which is
what you want from bonsai soil. So in that respect it acts like Akadama or
Kanume - and is a lot less expensive. Many people successfully use Turface
instead of Akadama
