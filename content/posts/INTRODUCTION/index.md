Bonsai (盆栽, "tray planting") is a Japanese art form using trees grown in containers.
Similar practices exist in other cultures, including the Chinese tradition
of penjing from which the art originated. Japanese tradition dates back over a
thousand years. "Bonsai" is a Japanese pronunciation of the earlier Chinese
term penzai. The purposes of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and
the pleasant exercise of effort and ingenuity (for the grower), by contrast with other
plant cultivation practices, bonsai is not intended for production of food or for
medicine.

Instead, bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping of
one or more small trees growing in a container.
A bonsai is created beginning with a specimen of source material. This may be a
cutting, seedling, or small tree of a species suitable for bonsai development. Bonsai
can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree or shrub species that
produces true branches and can be cultivated to remain small through pot
confinement with crown and root pruning. Some species are popular as bonsai
material because they have characteristics, such as small leaves or needles that make
them appropriate for the compact visual scope of bonsai.
The source specimen is shaped to be relatively small and to meet the aesthetic
standards of bonsai. When the candidate bonsai nears its planned final size it is
planted in a display pot, usually one designed for bonsai display in one of a
few accepted shapes and proportions. From that point forward, its growth is
restricted by the pot environment. Throughout the year, the bonsai is shaped to limit
growth, redistribute foliar vigor to areas requiring further development, and meet
the artist's detailed design.

The practice of bonsai is sometimes confused with dwarfing, but dwarfing generally
refers to research, discovery, or creation of plant cultivars that are permanent,
genetic miniatures of existing species. Bonsai does not require genetically dwarfed
trees, but rather depends on growing small trees from regular stock and seeds.
Bonsai uses cultivation techniques like pruning, root reduction, potting, defoliation,
and grafting to produce small trees that mimic the shape and style of mature, full-size
trees.
