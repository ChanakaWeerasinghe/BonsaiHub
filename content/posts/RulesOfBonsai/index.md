1. Height should be six times the caliper of the trunk.
2. Trunk should lean slightly toward the viewer.
3. Trunk should flare at base to visually anchor the plant.
4. Roots should radiate from the flare.
5. No eye-poking roots (directly at viewer).
6. Apex should lean toward viewer.
7. Trunk should taper as it ascends. No reverse taper.

9. placed low enough to disappear into the nebari.
10. Curves in trunk should not result in 'pigeon breast' (roundness toward viewer).
11. Apex should finish in the direction set by the base. 'Flow' should be maintained.
12. Trunk line should not move 'back on itself'. It relates to the flow of the tree. A

14. For formal and informal upright, the apex should be over the base.
15. In informal uprights, too many 'S' curves will be tiresome.
16. As a tree ascends the curves should be closer together (related to branch
placement).
17. A tree should have only one apex.
18. Twin tree trunks should divide at the base, not higher up.
