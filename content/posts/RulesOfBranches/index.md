1. No crossing branches or branches that cross the trunk.
2. No eye-poking branches (pointed directly at viewer).
3.First branch should be placed approximately 1/3 the height of the tree.
4. Succeeding branches placed at 1/3 the remaining distance to the top of the tree.
5. Branches go on the outside of the curves (No belly branches).
6. Branch caliper should be in proportion to the trunk. Branches that are thicker than
7. 1/3 the trunk caliper will be too thick.
8. First branch should be left (or right), second branch right (or left), third branch
should be back branch.

9. Branches should visually alternate, no parallel branches.
10. Branches should diminish in size and caliper as they ascend.
11. There should be space between the branches to 'Let the birds fly through'.
12. First and second branches (Left and Right branches) should be placed forward of
the mid line to 'invite' the viewer.
13. First, second, and third branches are approximate 120 degrees apart, with the back
branch not directly behind the tree.
14. Only one branch per trunk position, no 'wheel and spoke' or whorled branches, or
bar branches (branches directly opposite each other).
15. Branches should create an outline of a scalene triangle with the apex representing
16. God, the middle corner man and the lower corner earth.
17. Secondary branches should alternate left and right and follow the rules of main
branch placement, except there should be no secondary branches moving up or
down. This creates the foliage pad.
18. To create the illusion of an old tree, wire the branches down. Young trees have
ascending branches. The branches near and in the apex can be horizontal or
ascend since this is the young part of the tree.
19. Branches for cascades generally follow the rules for uprights, except that the trunk
moves down.

20. In twin trees, there should not be branches between the trees which would cross
the trunks. The outside branches of both trees create the triangle of foliage.
21. A jin should not be hidden in foliage.
