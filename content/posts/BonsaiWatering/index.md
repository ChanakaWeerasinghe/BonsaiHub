More Bonsai die thru incorrect watering than any other cause, with the
majority of those caused by “overwatering”. When the surface of the soil feels dry to the
touch, water the plant until entire root ball is wet. DO NOT water again until the soil surface
feels dry again. This can be as frequent as three times a day or as infrequent as every 3 days
depending upon several conditions including time of year, plant health, and soil composition.
The question then becomes; is the soil bone dry, moist, wet, or soggy?
Bone Dry: “The complete absence of moisture in the soil”. While some plants such as sand
pine, Japanese black pine, boxwood, and junipers like their soil a bit on the dry side, no plant
can stand a bone dry condition for very long.
Moist: “Soil feels cool to the touch; is loose and crumbly”. This is the best and safest condition
for most plants.

Wet: “The saturation point for granular soil; particles cling but separate easily.” Wet soil is
appropriate for bog plants such as cypress, tupelo, and maple. If the soil remains saturated for
long, there is a problem that must be identified. Either pot drainage is poor or the plant’s roots
are not functioning correctly. Look for the issue and correct it.
Soggy: “The saturation point for muck, clay and other soils with small grain” Soil will pack into
a solid ball when squeezed together. Soggy soil leaves no air spaces and plants literally drown.
Notes: After a plant’s foliage has been misted, the soil will feel deceptively moist; however,
the soil underneath the surface may be dangerously dry. Be careful
Caution: If you allow your Bonsai to become “Bone Dry”, DO NOT plunge it in a pan of water
and attempt to wet the entire root ball, instead lightly mist the foliage and place the plant in
the shade until late evening. At this time you can return the plant to its normal spot and allow
the morning dew to revive the fibrous roots along with the regular watering cycle.

### Remember these 5 key points to watering your Bonsai.
1. A newly potted plant will use less water than an established one.
2. A plant in a small pot is to be watered with more frequency.
3. The larger the leaf, the more water the plant will need.
4. Hot sun or windy weather will necessitate the need for more water.
5. Less water will be needed in winter or during dormancy.
