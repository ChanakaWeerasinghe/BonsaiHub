1. Signs of good health and stability such as leaf color and well
   settled, natural looking moss. No signs of carelessness and abuse
   such as badly healed pruning scars or scars from wire left on too
   long.
2. A strong well shaped trunk springing naturally from the soil and
   moving upwards towards the apex in an even taper.
3. A good fanning out of surface roots (nebari) from the base of the
   trunk gradually disappearing into the soil.
4. A good, well-proportioned head of branches which are well spaced
   and appear to spring naturally from the trunk or from larger
   branches.
5. The tree is as natural looking as possible considering its species,
   style, and size.

6. The pot must be in proportion to the tree to form an artistic unity.
7. The tree should be placed in the pot so as to create a visual
   balance
8. Flowers, fruit, and leaves must be in proportion.
9. A tree growing with its roots clasping a rock must really adhere to
   the rock, not just wrap around it.
10. A tree should be planted well raised in its pot so that the bole can
    be clearly seen over the rim of the pot when viewed at eye level.
11. Stones, moss or other covering on the surface of the soil mok
    natural and in scale.
