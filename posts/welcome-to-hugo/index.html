Here are some things you need to know as a beginner in the art of bonsai
Bonsai has long been an art of tree training
Bonsai has long been an art of tree training. Patience and procrastination are recognized by many experts as its hallmarks. Bonsai have no barriers to training a plant from an early age. What about a grown plant? When choosing a small plant, it is important to grow it. Bonsai designs do not grow without growth. Necessary branches growing over time, even a mature stem Sharing shoots is systematic.</p>
<p>If a plant that has not grown
Must grow the plant.</p>
<p>The taper of the tree trunk should be trained until it looks proper.</p>
<p>It is important to maintain a new root system by removing the grown roots in the plant.</p>
<p>In shallow flat, larger pots (preferably plastic) the trees should be allowed to grow well. It is also important to apply the right fertilizer ratio at the right time. Facilitating rooting to the ground will bring many additional benefits. or a Planting alone in the ground after the main pruning also gives successful results.</p>
<p>When the tree is growing, select the proper shape and face and prune the unwanted branches.</p>
<p>The main branches of the wire should be shaped like a mature tree.</p>
<p>The primary goal should be to grow branches. Until then do not rush to process shoots. 8 Do not prune the branches until they have reached the proper size.</p>
<p>Once the branches have grown to the required size, care should be taken to prune and divide the shoots, targeting the triangular shape.</p>
<p>Tricks to reduce the size of the leaves when dividing the shoots and forming a branch layer (Complete or partial pruning of the leaves, including lowering the fertilizer rate) should be followed.</p>
<p>If a grown plant
All branches should be removed, leaving only the branches that feel needed by the large root cuttings.
Then the tree should be revitalized using a mixture of well-rooted hormones and soil. (Propagation is appropriate)
It is important to follow steps 4 above until the plant is well adapted to normal shoots and then grows on the twigs.</p>
