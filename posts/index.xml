      <description>To easily create a bonsai you need to choose a suitable tree but there are three ways you can create an existing plant
Method 1 Creating a bonsai from a small plant
This is a bit difficult because we have to wait a long time to make a good design but you can create the kind of bonsai you want with this method but it takes a long time because it grows little by little but you have to wait a long time.</description>

      <description>Bonsai (盆栽, &amp;ldquo;tray planting&amp;rdquo;) is a Japanese art form using trees grown in containers. Similar practices exist in other cultures, including the Chinese tradition of penjing from which the art originated. Japanese tradition dates back over a thousand years. &amp;ldquo;Bonsai&amp;rdquo; is a Japanese pronunciation of the earlier Chinese term penzai. The purposes of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and the pleasant exercise of effort and ingenuity (for the grower), by contrast with other plant cultivation practices, bonsai is not intended for production of food or for medicine.</description>

      <title>Principles of Bonsai</title>

      <description>Not all plants are equally effective as bonsai. To produce a realistic illusion of a mature tree, look for plants with the following characteristics:
  Small leaves or needles. Short internodes, or distances between leaves. Attractive bark or roots. Branching characteristics for good twig forms.  All parts of the ideal bonsai — trunk, branches, twigs, leaves, flowers, fruits, buds, roots — should be in perfect scale with the size of the tree.</description>

      <description>This step-by-step pictorial is designed to guide beginners through the mechanical process of cutting, shaping and transplanting fairly simple bonsai material for the first time. It makes the assumption that the reader has already done some research and has a basic understanding of the fundamental shaping concepts used in the art of bonsai such as:
  Triangulation and asymmetrical composition. Primary, secondary and tertiary branch identification and placement. Selection of primary viewing angle based on trunk movement and rootage .</description>

      <description>Bonsai Styles It is important for you to remember, as a beginner, that no single bonsai style is the “right” style. Bonsai is meant to be a representation of a tree in nature. Crafting a bonsai masterpiece is tantamount to how YOU view that tree. You are not learning from a bonsai master, you are simply being given instruction on how to create your own bonsai. What you make of it lies simply in your own mind.</description>

      <title>Bonsai Watering</title>

      <description>More Bonsai die thru incorrect watering than any other cause, with the majority of those caused by “overwatering”. When the surface of the soil feels dry to the touch, water the plant until entire root ball is wet. DO NOT water again until the soil surface feels dry again. This can be as frequent as three times a day or as infrequent as every 3 days depending upon several conditions including time of year, plant health, and soil composition.</description>

      <description>Buying a Bonsai tree in a shop is nice, but wouldn’t it be much better to do it yourself? A great way to start growing Bonsai trees is to buy a starterkit and style the tree into a Bonsai. A starterkit can be purchased at many (online) Bonsai shops, but you could also choose to buy only a young plant at a local gardencenter. This article explains the steps to grow a Bonsai tree from a starterkit.</description>

      <description>Height should be six times the caliper of the trunk. Trunk should lean slightly toward the viewer. Trunk should flare at base to visually anchor the plant. Roots should radiate from the flare. No eye-poking roots (directly at viewer). Apex should lean toward viewer. Trunk should taper as it ascends. No reverse taper. Grafts should match under stock and scion so that they are unobtrusive, or be   placed low enough to disappear into the nebari.</description>

No eye-poking branches (pointed directly at viewer). 3.First branch should be placed approximately 1/3 the height of the tree. Succeeding branches placed at 1/3 the remaining distance to the top of the tree. Branches go on the outside of the curves (No belly branches). Branch caliper should be in proportion to the trunk. Branches that are thicker than 1/3 the trunk caliper will be too thick.</description>

      <description>There are many different soil mixtures used to plant bonsai. Bonsai people in Florida, Scotland, Holland, Japan, Canada and California all have different growing conditions and different materials available to make soil mixtures. Most mixtures have one thing in common &amp;ndash; they don&amp;rsquo;t use garden soil. This is because shallow pots don&amp;rsquo;t drain as well as soil in the garden and as a result the roots can stay too wet and rot!</description>

      <description>Signs of good health and stability such as leaf color and well settled, natural looking moss. No signs of carelessness and abuse such as badly healed pruning scars or scars from wire left on too long. A strong well shaped trunk springing naturally from the soil and moving upwards towards the apex in an even taper. A good fanning out of surface roots (nebari) from the base of the trunk gradually disappearing into the soil.</description>
