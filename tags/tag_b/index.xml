      <description>Bonsai (盆栽, &amp;ldquo;tray planting&amp;rdquo;) is a Japanese art form using trees grown in containers. Similar practices exist in other cultures, including the Chinese tradition of penjing from which the art originated. Japanese tradition dates back over a thousand years. &amp;ldquo;Bonsai&amp;rdquo; is a Japanese pronunciation of the earlier Chinese term penzai. The purposes of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and the pleasant exercise of effort and ingenuity (for the grower), by contrast with other plant cultivation practices, bonsai is not intended for production of food or for medicine.</description>

      <description>Signs of good health and stability such as leaf color and well settled, natural looking moss. No signs of carelessness and abuse such as badly healed pruning scars or scars from wire left on too long. A strong well shaped trunk springing naturally from the soil and moving upwards towards the apex in an even taper. A good fanning out of surface roots (nebari) from the base of the trunk gradually disappearing into the soil.</description>
