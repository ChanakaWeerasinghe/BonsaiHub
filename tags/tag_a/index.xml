      <description>There are many different soil mixtures used to plant bonsai. Bonsai people in Florida, Scotland, Holland, Japan, Canada and California all have different growing conditions and different materials available to make soil mixtures. Most mixtures have one thing in common &amp;ndash; they don&amp;rsquo;t use garden soil. This is because shallow pots don&amp;rsquo;t drain as well as soil in the garden and as a result the roots can stay too wet and rot!</description>

      <description>Signs of good health and stability such as leaf color and well settled, natural looking moss. No signs of carelessness and abuse such as badly healed pruning scars or scars from wire left on too long. A strong well shaped trunk springing naturally from the soil and moving upwards towards the apex in an even taper. A good fanning out of surface roots (nebari) from the base of the trunk gradually disappearing into the soil.</description>
