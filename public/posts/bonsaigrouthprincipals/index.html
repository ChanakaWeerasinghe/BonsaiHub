              <p>This step-by-step pictorial is designed to guide beginners through the mechanical process of cutting, shaping
and transplanting fairly simple bonsai material for the first
time. It makes the assumption that the reader has already
done some research and has a basic understanding of the
fundamental shaping concepts used in the art of bonsai
such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Triangulation and asymmetrical composition.</li>
<li>Primary, secondary and tertiary branch identification and placement.</li>
<li>Selection of primary viewing angle based on
trunk movement and rootage .
If you do not understand the three concepts outlined
above, you would be well advised to invest in a little more
research time before beginning this exercise. This is because the single most difficult thing for beginners to master
is the ability to “see” the bonsai hiding inside the mass of</li>
</ol>
<p>greenery from which they most often work. A firm grasp of
the fundamentals is of paramount to enhancing your ability
to identify usable and non-usable elements of the plant
material. Once you have that, the ability to “see” becomes
gradually clearer with more and more practice.
For this exercise, we have selected a Dwarf Japanese Garden Juniper (Juniperus procumbens nana). We
have done so because, junipers are particularly good
specimens for beginners to practice on and because they
are extremely vigorous growers with flexible branches and
trunks. They like full sun, but will grow happily in a wide
variety of locations and conditions. They also have the
added advantage of being a bit “forgiving” when newcomers make mistakes.
Since you are learning, we assume you will be making a few mistakes along the way. Its good to have plant
material which is willing to work with you. Junipers (par</p>
<h3 id="step-one-clean-up">Step One: Clean Up</h3>
<p>It will be impossible to make any effective decisions
about the styling of the tree until is possible to ascertain
what the existing trunk shape and branch placement is.
The first task is, therefore, to clean up the tree. Start by
removing the bamboo stake and then begin cleaning out
all dead needles and other debris from the interior of the
tree.
One of the things which make junipers good material for bonsai is they readily develop new growth on old
wood. This is a good characteristic for any bonsai subject
to have. However, initially a great deal of this rampant
budding along the trunk must be removed in order to see
the trees shape. Start at the bottom of the tree and begin
removing green buds and suckers which obstruct your
view of the trunk. At the same time remove green growth
from the interior of each branch an inch or so thus allowing
you to see the position of each branch as it relates to the
trunk.
Once you have completed this task you will be able
to clearly see the shape of the trunk and where each of the
branches emerge around it. Next, dig gently at the base of
the trunk and remove soil until you find the point at which
the roots begin to flare outward. This will be the base of
your new bonsai.</p>
<h3 id="step-two-wiring--shaping">Step Two: Wiring &amp; Shaping</h3>
<p>Once you can clearly see the trunk line and branches
you may begin to make artistic decisions regarding the
final appearance of your bonsai. As mentioned earlier,
these decisions should be based on your clear understanding of the fundamentals of bonsai design and will be
applied to each type of plant material on which you work in
the future.
Find a front for the tree based on the trunk movement and nebari. Select its first, second and back branches. Determine an apex and the placement of all secondary branching. Remove all others. In a word&hellip; Cut off
anything that does not look like a bonsai.</p>
<p>We know this is easy to say and not so easy to do,
but proceed slowly and carefully. Remember that it is better to leave a branch on the tree, wire it and try to work it
into the final composition than to remove it first and later
discover that is was needed. Let the Japanese concept
of “less is more,” guide you in this. You are trying to make
the most dramatic statement possible by using the fewest
amount of words&hellip; or in this case, branches.
In the case of this juniper we have decided to move
the top of the trunk to a different location. We will adjust
this and the branch positions by using wire. A main line
trunk wire of sufficient thickness to hold the bend in the
apex is inserted into the soil about an inch or so to anchor
it. It is then wrapped up the trunk, snug against same and
at about a forty-five degree angle perpendicular to the line
of the trunk.
Once this is completed, branches may be wired. Always use one piece of wire to wrap and bend two branches. Since the branches are thinner, the wire used may be
smaller, but still of sufficient thickness to hold the branch in
place once it is bent.
Hold the branch securely between your thumb and
forefinger and wrap the wire around the branch. Then,
with the second half of the wire make at least one turn
around the trunk (more of necessary) following the path
of the main line trunk wire until you can go out the second
branch .</p>
<h3 id="step-three-detail-pruning-">Step Three: Detail Pruning &amp;</h3>
<p>Shaping.
Once you have move all the branches into the approximate positions for your final design, trim back the
length of branches to establish the overall shape of the
tree. Remember that all bonsai have a triangular shape.
In most cases, the largest and longest branches are
located at the bottom. Branches gradually get thinner and
shorter as they approach the apex.
Once you have shortened the branches to the
desired length and established a well balanced composition, begin to work on each individual branch. Remove
all green growth which emerges from the bottom of these
branches. (Trees do not grow leaves out of the bottom of
a branch) and cut or pinch back foliage on the tops and
sides of each branch until they begin to develop a pad like
shape. In the future, as the tree grows and develops you
will need to keep these foliage pads pinched back and well
formed. They will become more dense with green growth
and add greatly to it’s appearance of age and maturity.</p>
<h3 id="step-four-preparation-for-potting">Step Four: Preparation For Potting</h3>
<p>The process of transplanting a bonsai from its growing container into a finished bonsai container can be compared to selecting the right frame for a painting. A wise
and compatible choice can make a dramatic difference in
how the whole composition is perceived.
Beginners should be aware that no matter what the
size, shape or color of the container they select, it must
meet one very important requirement. Containers must
always provide sufficient space for the growth and health
of the root system. This is a purely horticultural consideration and not an artistic one, but it is very important. The
container you select may look fabulous with the tree, but if
it fails to provide sufficient room for the healthy growth of
the trees roots, it will very shortly not matter what it looks
like. Make sure the pot you pick out is big enough.
There are a number of bonsai guidelines dealing
with the sizes, shapes and glazes on containers when
used in combinations with the various varieties and styles.
As you study the art you will become more familiar with
which containers work best for a particular tree. The juniper in this example will be potted into an unglazed rectangular pot of Chinese manufacture.</p>
